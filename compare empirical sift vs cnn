SIFT: Scale Invariant Feature Transform: a computer vision algorithm to detect, describe, and match local features in images,
SIFT keypoints of objects are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database,
It locates certain key points and then furnishes them with quantitative information which can be used for object recognition,
Invariant to scaling, rotation and translation,
The feature extraction and learning process of SIFT is very different than the processing in the human brain
Simpler deign and less parameters to set compared to CNN 
Less processing power needed, memory needed for storing features for each image
Smaller training set and faster than CNN 
More relevant for identification tasks 
Can be used for real time scenarios




CNN: Convolutional Neural Network:  is a class of artificial neural network, used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data,
use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vison that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing,
uses a system much like a multilayer perceptron that has been designed for reduced processing requirements. The layers of a CNN consist of an input layer, an output layer and a hidden layer that includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers,
The removal of constraints and increase in image processing efficiency leads in a system that is significantly more effective and easier to train for image processing and natural language processing,
The way of feature extraction and generalization from simple to complex is much more similar to the processing in the human visual system,
Needs experience to make design decisions,
High demand for processing during the training phase, memory needed to store the weights of the network,
The bigger the training set the better and slower than SIFT,
More relevant for classification and categorization tasks, has very good generalization abilities,
