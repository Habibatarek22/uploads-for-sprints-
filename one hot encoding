one-hot encoding: used for conversion between categorical Data "variables that are made up of label values" to Numerical Data, 
ensures that machine learning does not assume that higher numbers are more important and improve predictions, 
convert each categorical value into a new categorical column and assign a binary value of 1 or 0 to those columns, each integer value is represented as a binary vector. All the values are zero, and the index is marked with a 1.
useful for data that has no relationship to each other.
We can more easily establish a probability for our values if we use numeric numbers. For our output values, we choose one hot encoding in particular because it delivers more complex predictions than single labels.



Unique-ID encoding: a numeric or alphanumeric string that is associated with a single entity within a given system
identifier that marks that particular record as unique from every other record
allows for updates or deletes to overwrite the correct record. Without a unique identifier, the updated record or the delete request cannot match to the intended record in the index.
