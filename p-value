p-value in hypothesis testing: the p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. 
The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.


A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance.
The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.
P-value can be used as an alternative to or in addition to pre-selected confidence levels for hypothesis testing.

how is P-value calculated: calculated from the deviation between the observed value and a chosen reference value, given the probability distribution of the statistic, with a greater difference between the two values corresponding to a lower p-value.
The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis, also known as the conjecture, is the initial claim about a population
