Single layer perceptron is the first proposed neural model created,
The content of the local memory of the neuron consists of a vector of weights,
The computation of a single layer perceptron is performed over the calculation of sum of the input vector each with the value multiplied by corresponding element of vector of the weights,
The value which is displayed in the output will be the input of an activation function.
Steps:
1)The weights are initialized with random values at the beginning of the training.
2)For each element of the training set, the error is calculated with the difference between desired output and the actual output. The error calculated is used to adjust the weights.
3)The process is repeated until the error made on the entire training set is not less than the specified threshold, until the maximum number of iterations is reached.
Perceptron is mainly used to classify the data into two parts.
